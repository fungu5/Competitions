Your coworker [posted this photo](https://metaproblems.com/97325662d1ec839c353ff2c6127843ed/photo.jpg) of their room at a ranch they are currently vacationing at. Can you figure out the name of the ranch?

Solution:
I saved the page and then checked the image properties on my windows host. This gives you the GPS coordinates. Plugging the coordinates into North and West long/lat you can find the city then find Big River Ranch.
