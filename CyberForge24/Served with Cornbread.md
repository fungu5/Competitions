A _hashing algorithm_ is a "one-way function" that takes in some input - like a file, or a piece of text - and outputs a short fixed-length code, known as a _hash_. You cannot reverse the hash to determine the input, but the same input always produces the same hash - and ideally, two different inputs always produce two different hashes.

Take a look at this hash: `$2y$10$ykaZELcq0yVDSst0o2w/g.kvhVyc4Z99KUC7xkMFlmxA2Lz4KZMW2`

Solution:
Just googled 'hashing algorithm with 60 characters' and got bcrypt
